I created this website to practice web development fundamentals that I have learned during my first two weeks of coding bootcamp. Some fundamentals that I learned included: HTML semantic elements, CSS styling, Flexbox, any many more. I will continue to add more features to my webpage as the bootcamp weeks go by, in order to apply my newly found knowledge.
My practice website is dedicated to my two Siberian huskies: Ace and Zoey. 
I first began with writing out the code in an HTML file which contained all the content that I wanted my webpage to display. After the HTML files were made, I proceeded to style them with a CSS file that I linked between the head tags in my HTML file. 
Lastly, I created a README file to contain a description of my practice webpage.
