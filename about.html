                Ace and Zoey are very cute Siberian Huskies. Ace is six years old and loves sleeping, eating treats, and going outside. His nickname is Acey Lazy because he loves to lounge around the house and take naps all day. Zoey is four years old and loves cuddling, attention, and also the outdoors. Her nickname is Zoey Boey because I couldn't find any word that rhymes with her name. They both love playing a game we invented, called "search and sniff", where I hide treats all over the house and they have to sniff them out. Ace is better at playing the game because he's had more years of experience playing it. Zoey is a fast learner, and very treat motivated, so she will beat him in no time.

                Ace and Zoey have very different personalities. Ace is calm, gentle, and loves meeting new people and dogs. He is very friendly towards everyone. Ace will do anything for treats! Zoey is the opposite of Ace: she is hyper, paces around a lot, snores, and cannot be left alone. Zoey follows Ace everywhere. She is an anxious dog with separation anxiety, but we are working towards helping her be able to relax without depending on anyone else. Zoey is very wary of strangers, and dislikes smaller dogs: she will try to fight them.

                This is a picture of Ace and Zoey with matching bandanas. We took this picture at the pond in our neighborhood. Zoey was distracted looking at the ducks and geese that live in the pond, and Ace was distracted watching another dog getting walked. It is difficult to get both of them to take a good picture because they have the attention span of a goldfish. Ace is more photogenic than his sister, Zoey, but they are both very adorable!
